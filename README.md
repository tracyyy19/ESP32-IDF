This project involves creating a web server application on the ESP32 IDF platform, enabling users to control the states of green and red LEDs through a WebSocket connection.The ESP32 serves an HTML interface stored in SPIFFS, allowing users to toggle LEDs on/off. WebSocket communication ensures real-time updates on the interface.
